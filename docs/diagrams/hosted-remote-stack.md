# Hosted web and remote stack

Open the interactive diagram: **[hosted-remote-stack.html](./hosted-remote-stack.html)**

## What it shows

- **Hosted client** — `apps/web` on Vercel at `app.kata.sh` (static React UI, not the agent runtime)
- **Execution environment** — `katacode serve` (`apps/server`) as a long-running process on user-controlled infrastructure
- **Manual pairing** — “Add Environment” stores host + pairing code; browser connects directly over WebSocket
- **KataCode Connect** (optional) — Clerk identity + relay control plane + optional managed tunnel; not in the hot path for agent traffic
