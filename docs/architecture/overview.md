# Architecture

Kata Code is a **Node.js WebSocket server** (`apps/server`) that serves the React web app, orchestrates chat/git/terminal state, and routes agent work to **pluggable provider drivers** (Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, Pi). Clients use one typed API; each driver wraps its own agent runtime.

For driver details, see [provider architecture](/architecture/providers.md). For hosted clients vs where the server runs, see the [hosted web diagram](/diagrams/hosted-remote-stack.html).

## Components

- **Client app** (`apps/web`, plus desktop/mobile shells): Renders session state, owns the WebSocket transport, and treats typed push events as the boundary between server runtime details and UI state.

- **Server** (`apps/server`): Main coordinator. Serves the web app when embedded, accepts WebSocket requests, waits for startup readiness before welcoming clients, and sends all outbound pushes through a single ordered push path.

- **Provider layer**: `ProviderService` routes `providers.*` calls to a **provider instance adapter** selected by thread/settings. Built-in drivers include Codex (`codex app-server` over stdio), Claude Agent SDK, Cursor/Grok (ACP subprocesses), and OpenCode. Adapters emit canonical `ProviderRuntimeEvent` streams consumed by orchestration. See [provider architecture](/architecture/providers.md).

- **Background workers**: Long-running async flows such as runtime ingestion, command reaction, and checkpoint processing run as queue-backed workers. This keeps work ordered, reduces timing races, and gives tests a deterministic way to wait for the system to go idle.

- **Runtime signals**: The server emits lightweight typed receipts when important async milestones finish, such as checkpoint capture, diff finalization, or a turn becoming fully quiescent. Tests and orchestration code wait on these signals instead of polling internal state.

## Event Lifecycle

### Startup and client connect

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant Transport as WsTransport
    participant Server as wsServer
    participant Layers as serverLayers
    participant Ready as ServerReadiness
    participant Push as ServerPushBus

    Browser->>Transport: Load app and open WebSocket
    Transport->>Server: Connect
    Server->>Layers: Start runtime services
    Server->>Ready: Wait for startup barriers
    Ready-->>Server: Ready
    Server->>Push: Publish server.welcome
    Push-->>Transport: Ordered welcome push
    Transport-->>Browser: Hydrate initial state
```

1. The browser boots [`WsTransport`][1] and registers typed listeners in [`wsNativeApi`][2].
2. The server accepts the connection in [`wsServer`][3] and brings up the runtime graph defined in [`serverLayers`][7].
3. [`ServerReadiness`][4] waits until the key startup barriers are complete.
4. Once the server is ready, [`wsServer`][3] sends `server.welcome` from the contracts in [`ws.ts`][6] through [`ServerPushBus`][5].
5. The browser receives that ordered push through [`WsTransport`][1], and [`wsNativeApi`][2] uses it to seed local client state.

### User turn flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant Transport as WsTransport
    participant Server as wsServer
    participant Provider as ProviderService
    participant Adapter as Provider adapter
    participant Runtime as Agent runtime
    participant Ingest as ProviderRuntimeIngestion
    participant Engine as OrchestrationEngine
    participant Push as ServerPushBus

    Browser->>Transport: Send user action
    Transport->>Server: Typed WebSocket request
    Server->>Provider: Route providers.* request
    Provider->>Adapter: startSession / sendTurn / …
    Adapter->>Runtime: Provider-native protocol
    Runtime-->>Ingest: Provider runtime events
    Ingest->>Engine: Normalize into orchestration events
    Engine-->>Server: Domain events
    Server->>Push: Publish orchestration.domainEvent
    Push-->>Browser: Typed push
```

1. A user action in the browser becomes a typed request through [`WsTransport`][1] and the browser API layer in [`nativeApi`][12].
2. [`wsServer`][3] decodes that request using the shared WebSocket contracts in [`ws.ts`][6] and routes it to the right service.
3. [`ProviderService`][8] resolves the thread's **provider instance** and delegates to that instance's adapter (Codex app-server, Claude SDK, ACP CLI, OpenCode, …).
4. Provider-native events are pulled back into the server by [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][9], which converts them into orchestration events.
5. [`OrchestrationEngine`][10] persists those events, updates the read model, and exposes them as domain events.
6. [`wsServer`][3] pushes those updates to the browser through [`ServerPushBus`][5] on channels defined in [`orchestration.ts`][11].

### Async completion flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Server as wsServer
    participant Worker as Queue-backed workers
    participant Cmd as ProviderCommandReactor
    participant Checkpoint as CheckpointReactor
    participant Receipt as RuntimeReceiptBus
    participant Push as ServerPushBus
    participant Browser

    Server->>Worker: Enqueue follow-up work
    Worker->>Cmd: Process provider commands
    Worker->>Checkpoint: Process checkpoint tasks
    Checkpoint->>Receipt: Publish completion receipt
    Cmd-->>Server: Produce orchestration changes
    Checkpoint-->>Server: Produce orchestration changes
    Server->>Push: Publish resulting state updates
    Push-->>Browser: User-visible push
```

1. Some work continues after the initial request returns, especially in [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][9], [`ProviderCommandReactor`][13], and [`CheckpointReactor`][14].
2. These flows run as queue-backed workers using [`DrainableWorker`][16], which helps keep side effects ordered and test synchronization deterministic.
3. When a milestone completes, the server emits a typed receipt on [`RuntimeReceiptBus`][15], such as checkpoint completion or turn quiescence.
4. Tests and orchestration code wait on those receipts instead of polling git state, projections, or timers.
5. Any user-visible state changes produced by that async work still go back through [`wsServer`][3] and [`ServerPushBus`][5].
