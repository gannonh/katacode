# Mobile local dev — iOS Simulator

This runbook proves the first local mobile slice: **Kata Code Dev** on the iOS Simulator, paired to a loopback `katacode` server via bearer token (no Clerk, no relay). Design spec: [mobile local dev slice](/specs/2026-06-22-mobile-local-dev-slice-design.md).

## Prerequisites

- macOS with **Xcode** installed (`xcodebuild -version`).
- **iOS Simulator runtime** matching the installed Xcode SDK. If `expo run:ios` reports no eligible destinations, install the platform:

  ```bash
  xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS
  ```

  Then pick a simulator from the matching runtime:

  ```bash
  xcrun simctl list devices available
  ```

- **CocoaPods** (installed automatically by `expo prebuild` on first build).
- A built server CLI (`apps/server/dist/bin.mjs` exists after `pnpm run build` or routine dev setup).
- At least one **agent provider** configured on the host (same setup used for desktop/web dev).
- Optional: raise file-descriptor limits if native builds fail with `EMFILE` / `Too many open files` (common during first full Xcode compile).

## 1. Start the local server (pairing + runnable project)

`katacode serve` prints headless pairing output but does **not** auto-register a project. Use both steps:

**Terminal A — headless server with pairing output**

```bash
cd /path/to/kata-code
node apps/server/dist/bin.mjs serve --port 3773 --host 127.0.0.1
```

Wait for:

```text
Connection string: http://127.0.0.1:3773
Token: <ONE_TIME_TOKEN>
Pairing URL: http://127.0.0.1:3773/pair#token=<ONE_TIME_TOKEN>
```

Use the printed **Connection string** host (`127.0.0.1:3773` or `localhost:3773`) and **Token** in the Simulator pairing form. The token is one-time; restart `serve` if it expires before pairing.

**Terminal A (continued) — register a runnable project**

In a second shell against the same `KATACODE_HOME` (default `~/.katacode`):

```bash
node apps/server/dist/bin.mjs project add /path/to/your/repo
```

Replace `/path/to/your/repo` with a git repo the provider can run against. Confirm the project appears in the web/desktop client or server logs.

> **Local-only:** You do not need Kata Code Connect sign-in. Relay errors in server logs are expected when offline; pairing and threads still use the bearer path on loopback.

## 2. Build and launch the dev client

From `apps/mobile`:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
vp run dev:client    # Terminal B — Metro for the dev client (keep running)
vp run ios:dev       # Terminal C — prebuild (first time) + compile + install
```

First `ios:dev` runs `expo prebuild --clean --platform ios` and generates `ios/` (gitignored). Subsequent runs reuse the native project unless you pass a clean prebuild.

**Development variant notes**

- App name: **Kata Code Dev** (`com.katacode.dev`).
- Icons and splash use Kata brand rasters synced from `apps/desktop/resources/source.png` (`pnpm run generate:brand-rasters`). Splash and dev menu use `assets/icon.png`; the iOS home screen uses `icon-composer-prod.icon` (desktop Liquid Glass `kanji.png`).
- The Expo dev tools floating button is disabled (`toolsButton: false`) so it does not cover the app settings icon. Open the dev menu with **⌘D** in Simulator when needed.
- If the build targets an outdated simulator runtime, pass an explicit device id:

  ```bash
  xcrun simctl list devices available
  APP_VARIANT=development npx expo run:ios --device <SIMULATOR_UDID>
  ```

Success criteria: the app installs, launches to the home screen, and shows no redbox.

## 3. Pair from the Simulator (manual host + token)

1. Stay signed out of **Kata Code Connect** (no Clerk session required).
2. Open **Add Environment** (connections flow).
3. Enter:
   - **Host:** `127.0.0.1:3773` or `localhost:3773` (from the printed connection string, without `http://` is fine — loopback hosts default to HTTP).
   - **Pairing code:** the **Token** printed by `serve`.
4. Tap **Add environment**.
5. Confirm the saved environment shows a green **ConnectionStatusDot** (status **ready**).

Bearer bootstrap path: the saved connection uses `authenticationMethod: "bearer"` (not `relayManaged` / DPoP).

## 4. Run a thread end-to-end

1. Open the paired environment.
2. Start a **new thread**.
3. Send a prompt that triggers a real agent response. For tool/activity UI coverage, use a prompt that forces at least one tool call (for example: “List files in the project root using your tools”).
4. Confirm streamed assistant text appears on the Simulator.
5. Confirm the same thread is visible server-side (server logs, or web/desktop client against the same server).

## 5. Verification commands

```bash
# Mobile static checks (from repo root)
vp run --filter @kata-sh/code-mobile typecheck
vp run --filter @kata-sh/code-mobile test

# Optional: native static analysis
node scripts/mobile-native-static-check.ts
```
