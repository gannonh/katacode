# KataCode fork setup plan

Hard fork of [pingdotgg/t3code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) maintained at
[gannonh/katacode](https://github.com/gannonh/katacode).

This document is the source of truth for fork operations: identity, upstream sync,
release split, and intentional divergence. Update it whenever sync policy or branding
decisions change.

## Current status

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fork remote (`origin`) | Done | `https://github.com/gannonh/katacode.git` |
| Upstream remote (`upstream`) | Done | `https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code.git` |
| Baseline sync point | `708d5383` | Last merged upstream SHA — update after each sync |
| Product rename (`@t3tools/*` → fork scope) | Not started | See Phase 1 |
| Env prefix rename (`T3CODE_*`) | Not started | See Phase 1 |
| CI / release split from upstream | Not started | See Phase 2 |
| `FORK.md` divergence log | Started | This file |

## Goals

1. **Ship an independent product** (KataCode) without waiting on upstream contribution policy.
2. **Keep pulling upstream fixes and features** via merge-based sync, not ad-hoc cherry-picks.
3. **Minimize merge pain** by isolating fork-only code and completing branding renames early.
4. **Preserve MIT attribution** for upstream code and vendored dependencies.

## Non-goals (for now)

- Contributing changes back upstream (upstream is not actively accepting large PRs).
- Staying wire-compatible with upstream desktop auto-update channels or npm `t3` package.
- Maintaining feature parity with upstream cloud/T3 Connect unless explicitly chosen.

---

## Recommended identity map

Decide these once, then execute Phase 1 in a single focused branch. Suggested defaults
for this fork:

| Upstream | KataCode (proposed) |
|----------|---------------------|
| Product name | KataCode |
| GitHub repo | `gannonh/katacode` |
| npm scope | `@katacode/*` |
| CLI binary | `kata` (package name e.g. `@katacode/cli` or `katacode`) |
| Monorepo root package | `@katacode/monorepo` |
| Env prefix | `KATACODE_*` (keep `T3CODE_*` aliases temporarily if needed) |
| State dir default | `~/.katacode` (was `~/.t3`) |
| Desktop display name | KataCode (Dev) / KataCode |
| Desktop bundle id (prod) | `com.katacode.app` |
| Desktop bundle id (dev) | `com.katacode.dev.<worktree-suffix>` (mirror `electron-launcher.mjs` pattern) |
| URL protocol | `katacode` / `katacode-dev` |
| Published npm package | `@katacode/cli` or `katacode` (do **not** publish as `t3`) |

> Dev desktop bundle IDs already derive from the repo folder name (`katacode`) in
> `apps/desktop/scripts/electron-launcher.mjs`. Production bundle id and display names
> still use T3 branding until Phase 1.

---

## Phase 0 — Git remotes (complete)

```bash
cd /Volumes/EVO/dev/katacode
git remote -v
# origin   → gannonh/katacode
# upstream → pingdotgg/t3code
```

Clone convention for new machines:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gannonh/katacode.git
cd katacode
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code.git
git fetch upstream --tags
```

---

## Phase 1 — Branding and rename (do this first)

Complete before large feature work. One branch, one merge to `main`, then tag
`v0.1.0-katacode` (or similar) as the first fork-native release.

### 1.1 Package and import renames

Search targets (approximate counts will drop after renames):

```bash
# from repo root
rg -l '@t3tools/' --glob '!node_modules' --glob '!.git' --glob '!.repos'
rg -l 't3code' --glob '!node_modules' --glob '!.git' --glob '!.repos'
rg -l 'T3CODE_' --glob '!node_modules' --glob '!.git' --glob '!.repos'
```

Primary files and directories:

| Area | Paths |
|------|-------|
| Workspace | `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, all `apps/*/package.json`, all `packages/*/package.json` |
| Server CLI | `apps/server/package.json` (`name`, `bin`, `repository`) |
| Oxlint plugin | `oxlint-plugin-t3code/` → rename dir + package to `oxlint-plugin-katacode` |
| Relay infra | `infra/relay/package.json`, `infra/relay/README.md` |
| Import paths | Every `from "@t3tools/..."` across `apps/`, `packages/`, `scripts/` |
| VP filters | Root `package.json` scripts using `--filter @t3tools/...` |

Suggested approach:

1. Rename package `name` fields and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` entries.
2. Run `vp i` and fix broken workspace links.
3. Bulk-replace import specifiers (`@t3tools/` → `@katacode/`).
4. Rename `oxlint-plugin-t3code` directory and update lint config references.
5. `vp check && vp run typecheck`

### 1.2 Runtime env and state dirs

High-touch paths:

| File / area | What changes |
|-------------|--------------|
| `scripts/dev-runner.ts` | `T3CODE_*` env wiring, dev ports, mode flags |
| `scripts/lib/public-config.ts` | Public config env keys |
| `apps/server/src/cli/` | CLI flags, help text, default paths |
| `apps/desktop/scripts/electron-launcher.mjs` | `APP_DISPLAY_NAME`, `APP_BUNDLE_ID`, protocol schemes |
| `apps/desktop/package.json` | `productName` |
| `packages/shared/` | Any hard-coded `~/.t3` or `T3CODE_` references |

Prefer a short compatibility shim during transition (read both `KATACODE_*` and
`T3CODE_*`) only if you need parallel installs. Remove shims once stable.

### 1.3 User-facing docs

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | Rewrite for KataCode; link to upstream attribution |
| `AGENTS.md` | Update project snapshot; link to this file |
| `docs/README.md` | Add fork docs link |
| `docs/getting-started/quick-start.md` | Update install/run commands |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Replace with fork contribution policy |

Keep a short **Attribution** section in `README.md` crediting T3 Code (MIT).

### 1.4 Verification gate

```bash
vp i
vp run --filter @t3tools/desktop ensure:electron   # update filter after rename
vp check
vp run typecheck
pnpm run dev          # web
pnpm run dev:desktop  # electron
```

---

## Phase 2 — Infrastructure split

Decouple fork CI/CD and distribution from upstream.

### 2.1 GitHub Actions

Review and fork-customize:

| Workflow | Purpose | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | PR checks | Keep; remove upstream-only secrets |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Desktop/npm releases | Point artifacts to `gannonh/katacode`; new signing credentials |
| `.github/workflows/deploy-relay.yml` | Relay deploy | Disable or re-point to fork infra |
| `.github/workflows/mobile-eas-preview.yml` | Mobile | Disable until fork mobile signing exists |
| `.github/workflows/pr-vouch.yml` | Upstream trust labels | Remove or replace |
| `.github/workflows/pr-size.yml` | Size labels | Optional keep |
| `.github/workflows/issue-labels.yml` | Automation | Review |

### 2.2 Secrets and cloud config

Upstream-specific — do **not** reuse without explicit intent:

- Clerk / T3 Connect (`T3CODE_CLERK_*`, `docs/cloud/`)
- Relay OTLP endpoints (`T3CODE_RELAY_*`)
- Discord release webhooks (`scripts/notify-discord-release.ts`)
- Desktop code signing / notarization certificates
- npm publish tokens for `t3` package

Document fork equivalents in a private runbook (1Password / GitHub env secrets), not
in this repo.

### 2.3 Release channels

- Tag format: `v0.1.0` on `gannonh/katacode` only.
- Do not push tags to `upstream`.
- Disable or rewrite nightly cron in `release.yml` until fork release process is ready.
- Desktop auto-update feed must point at fork release URLs, not `pingdotgg/t3code`.

---

## Phase 3 — Upstream sync runbook

**Default strategy: merge `upstream/main` on a sync branch.** Use cherry-pick only for
individual hotfixes when a full merge is not ready.

### When to sync

- Weekly while upstream is active, or
- Before starting large fork features that touch `contracts`, `server`, or `web`, or
- When you need a specific upstream fix.

### Step-by-step

```bash
cd /Volumes/EVO/dev/katacode

# 1. Update local upstream refs
git fetch upstream --tags

# 2. Create sync branch from your main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b upstream-sync-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# 3. Merge upstream (prefer merge over rebase for hard forks)
git merge upstream/main
# resolve conflicts — see "High-conflict zones" below

# 4. Sync vendored reference repos if deps changed
vp run sync:repos
# or: node scripts/sync-reference-repos.ts

# 5. Reinstall and verify
vp i
vp run --filter @katacode/desktop ensure:electron
vp check
vp run typecheck
vp test

# 6. Merge sync branch to main
git checkout main
git merge upstream-sync-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
git push origin main

# 7. Update this file's "Last upstream sync" block
```

### High-conflict zones

Expect conflicts where both fork and upstream edit the same surfaces:

| Zone | Why |
|------|-----|
| `packages/contracts/` | Protocol/schema changes ripple everywhere |
| `packages/shared/` | Shared runtime utilities |
| `apps/server/` | Provider wiring, CLI, session lifecycle |
| `apps/web/` | UI state, WebSocket client, session UX |
| `apps/desktop/` | Electron main, backend manager, branding |
| `scripts/dev-runner.ts` | Dev env and ports |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | Always regenerate with `vp i` after merge |
| `package.json` (root + apps) | Scripts, filters, version bumps |

**Low-conflict strategy:** keep fork-only features in new modules/packages where
possible instead of editing upstream core files.

### Selective cherry-pick (exception path)

```bash
git fetch upstream
git cherry-pick <upstream-commit-sha>
```

Use when:

- You need one bugfix between scheduled merges.
- A merge is blocked but a security/reliability fix is urgent.

Always record cherry-picked SHAs in the divergence log below.

### Rejecting upstream changes

If you intentionally skip an upstream feature, log it:

```markdown
### Rejected upstream
- `<sha>` — <reason> — <date>
```

---

## Phase 4 — Divergence boundaries

Structure fork-specific work to reduce merge cost.

### Put fork-only code here

| Prefer | Avoid |
|--------|-------|
| New package under `packages/kata-*` | Sprinkling `if (katacode)` in upstream core |
| New app under `apps/kata-*` | Editing `packages/contracts` for fork-only fields |
| Adapter layer at provider boundary | Renaming upstream types in place |
| `docs/fork/` for fork docs | Rewriting upstream architecture docs in place |

### Vendored reference repos (`.repos/`)

Separate from git upstream sync. When upstream bumps Effect/Alchemy deps:

```bash
vp run sync:repos
# or sync one repo:
node scripts/sync-reference-repos.ts --repo <id>
```

Do not edit `.repos/` except via sync tooling (see `AGENTS.md`).

---

## Phase 5 — Ongoing maintenance

### Pre-merge checklist (fork PRs)

- [ ] `vp check`
- [ ] `vp run typecheck`
- [ ] Tests for touched packages
- [ ] No accidental upstream secret/config commits
- [ ] `FORK.md` updated if sync policy or divergence changed

### Post-upstream-sync checklist

- [ ] Conflict resolutions reviewed (not just accepted ours/theirs blindly)
- [ ] Branding rename intact (no `@t3tools` regression)
- [ ] `pnpm run dev` and `pnpm run dev:desktop` smoke-tested
- [ ] Desktop `ensure:electron` still passes on CI
- [ ] Last sync SHA recorded in this file

### Agent instructions

Coding agents working in this repo should:

1. Read `FORK.md` before large refactors or upstream merges.
2. Prefer merge-based upstream sync over cherry-pick unless asked otherwise.
3. Never push to `upstream` remote.
4. Keep MIT notices in files with substantial upstream-derived code.
